1. Write a query to select all books by a particular author and sort them by price in descending order: 
    select * from books where AuthorID=1 order by Price desc;


2. List all orders made by a particular customer, showing the order and total amount: 

    To show the TotalAmount of all the orders of one customer in descending order:
        Select TotalAmount from orders where customerID=1 order by  TotalAmount desc;

    To show details of all the orders of one customer:
        SELECT * 
            FROM OrderDetails 
            WHERE OrderID IN (
                SELECT OrderID 
                FROM Orders 
                WHERE CustomerID = 1
            );

    To join the column 'TotalAmount' from 'Orders' table and all columns from 'OrderDetails' in the mysql:
        SELECT od.*, o.TotalAmount
            FROM OrderDetails od
            JOIN Orders o ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
            WHERE o.CustomerID = 1 order by  TotalAmount desc;
